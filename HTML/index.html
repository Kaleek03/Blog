        <p class="test">I woke up at 5 am and went on a 4 mile run from 5:20 A.M to 6:20 A.M. I made breakfast and then went 
            and got creamer and coffee. After that i got on my computer and turned in a discussion post for school. Now i am working on creating a blog to help hold myself accountable. 
            I slacked in the past with development but this time i will be better. I am finishing this a day later. I was not nearly as productive as i wanted to be in the later half of the day

        <p>I originally wanted to go on a run this morning but was way to sore so insteasd i went for a 4 mile walk. I was home by 8:30 A.M after that I made myself breakfast then drank a bunch of water. Then i did some weight lifting. 
            once i was done with breakfast and working out I cleaned the bedroom and took apart our fan to deep cleen it. my plans for the rest of the day is to do a section of my chemistry book then add some styling to this page.
