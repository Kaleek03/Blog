        <p class="test">I woke up at 5 am and went on a 4 mile run from 5:20 A.M to 6:20 A.M. I made breakfast and then went 
            and got creamer and coffee. After that i got on my computer and turned in a discussion post for school. Now i am working on creating a blog to help hold myself accountable. 
            I slacked in the bast with development but this time i will be better.
